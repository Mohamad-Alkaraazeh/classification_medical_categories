# classification_medical_categories

+ This project, conducted by students (Mohamad Alkaraazeh, [Sepideh Hosseini Dehkordi](https://github.com/Sepideh-hd), [William Kana Tsoplefack](https://github.com/Boby024)), aims to develop a medical search engine. We plan to employ classification techniques and leverage machine learning to analyze the data. The objective is to build a model that can predict medical categories in the German language. Ultimately, we will visualize the outcomes to effectively display the results.

## Implementation approach
### Algorithms
+ Classification
+ Prediction
+ Accuracy test
### Methods
+ BERT transformers
+ One-Vs-Rest strategies
